         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

                  <p>This City was it, which for the ſpace of ſome hundred yeares con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended with <hi>Rome,</hi> for the Empire of the World.

                  </p>
                  <p>In the firſt warre of the three, the contention was for the Iles of <hi>Cici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lia, Corſica,</hi> and <hi>Sardinia:</hi> when the victory fell to the <hi>Romans,</hi> and the <hi>Carthaginians</hi> were glad to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deeme
<pb n="168" facs="tcp:16256:88"/>their peace with the leaving of thoſe Ilands.</p>
                  <p>The ſecond warre was begun by <hi>Hannibal,</hi> who brake the League, and after he had taken ſome part of <hi>Spain</hi> from the <hi>Romanes,</hi> and ſac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked <hi>Saguntum,</hi> a Citie of their Friends, came firſt over the <hi>Pyrenay</hi> hils to <hi>France,</hi> then over the <hi>Alpes</hi> to <hi>Italy,</hi> where hee overthrew the <hi>Romanes</hi> in three great Battels, and much endangered their eſtate: hee continued in <hi>Italy</hi> with his Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my ſixteene yeares, till <hi>Scipio</hi> at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempting on <hi>Carthage,</hi> forced <hi>Han<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nibal</hi> to returne to reſcue his owne Countrey.

                  <p>In the third Warre (becauſe the people of <hi>Carthage</hi> ſtill brake the League) their City was razed to the very ground by the earneſt and continuall counſell of <hi>Cato</hi> the Elder, fearing evermore ſo dange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous a Neighbour, though <hi>Scipio

               <p>The Maps which were made at firſt concerning <hi>America,</hi> &amp; <hi>Peru,</hi> did ſo deſcribe the Weſterne part of <hi>Peru,</hi> as if when a man had paſſed
<pb n="340" facs="tcp:16256:174"/>
                  <hi>Magellane</hi> Straits, and did intend to come upwards towards <hi>Nova Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpania,</hi> on the further ſide, he muſt have borne much Weſt, by reaſon that the Land did ſhoot out with a very great Promontory, and ben<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding that way.</p>
               <p>But our <hi>Engliſhmen</hi> which went with Sir <hi>Francis Drake,</hi> did by their owne experience certainely finde that the Land from the uttermoſt end of the Straits on <hi>Peru</hi> ſide, did goe up towards the South di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rectly, without bending to the Weſt; and that is the cauſe where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore all the new Maps and Globes, eſpecially made by the <hi>Engliſh,</hi> or by the <hi>Dutch,</hi> who have taken their directions from our men, are reformed according to this new obſervation.</p>
               <p>When the <hi>Spaniards</hi> had once found an ordinary paſſage from the South Sea towards the <hi>Moluccoes,</hi> they never ceaſed to travaile that way, and diſcovered more and more: and by that meanes they have found out divers Ilands not
<pb n="341" facs="tcp:16256:174"/>knowne in former Ages; as two for example ſake, a good diſtance from the <hi>Moluccoes,</hi> which becauſe<note n="*" place="margin">Inſulae Latronum.</note> they be inhabited by men which do ſteale not only each from other, but doe pilfer away all things that they can from ſuch ſtrangers as doe land thereabouts, they are called <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſulae Latronum.</hi>

               <p>When <hi>Magellanus</hi> was come downe to the Southerne end of <hi>Peru,</hi> he found on the further ſide of the Straits a maine and huge land lying towards the South-Pole, which ſome of his name called ſince<note n="*" place="margin">Regio Magella<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nica.</note> 
                  <hi>Regio Magellanica,</hi> and that ſo much the rather, becauſe he touch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed upon it againe before he came to the <hi>Moluccoes.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Since his time, the <hi>Portugales</hi> travelling towards <hi>Calecut,</hi> and the Eaſt-<hi>Indies,</hi> there have ſome of them bin driven by tempeſt ſo far; as to that which many now call the South Continent; and ſo divers of ſundry Nations, have there by oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion touched upon it.</p>
               <p>It is found therefore by experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, for to goe along all the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees of longitude, and as in ſome places, it is certainely diſcovered to come up ſo high towards the North, as to the <hi>Tropicke</hi> of <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pricorne,</hi> ſo it is conjectured, that towards the South it goeth as farre as to the Pole. The ground whereof is, that never any man did perceive
<pb n="344" facs="tcp:16256:176"/>the Sea did paſſe thorow any part thereof: nay, there is not any great River which hath yet beene deſcri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bed to come out of it into the O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cean: whereupon it is concluded, that ſince ſomewhat muſt fill up the Globe of the Earth from the firſt appearing of this land unto the very Pole, and that cannot be any Sea, unleſſe it ſhould be ſuch a one as hath no entercourſe with the Ocean (which to imagine is uncertaine) therefore it is ſuppoſed that it com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth whole out into the Land to the Antarticke Pole: which if it ſhould be granted, it muſt needs be acknowledged withall that this ſpace of Earth is ſo huge, as that it equalleth in greatneſſe not only <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſia, Europe,</hi> and <hi>Africa,</hi> but almoſt <hi>America,</hi> being joyned unto them.</p>
               <p>Things memorable in this Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey are yet reported to be very few; only in the Eaſt part of it over againſt the <hi>Moluccoes,</hi> ſome have written that there bee very waſte countries and wilderneſſes; but we find not ſo much as mention whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther

               <p>Concerning thoſe places which may be ſuppoſed to lie neere unto the Northerne Pole, there hath in times paſt ſomething been written, which for the particularity thereof might carry ſome ſhew of truth, if it be not throughly looked into. It is therefore by an olde tradition delivered, and by ſome written alſo, that there was a Fryer of <hi>Oxen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ford,</hi> who took on him to travaile, into thoſe parts, which are under the very Pole; which he did partly by Negromancie (wherein hee was much skilled) and partly againe by taking advantage of the frozen times, by meanes whereof he might travell upon the Ice even ſo as him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe pleaſed: It is ſaid therefore of him, that he was directly under the Pole, and that there he found a very huge and blacke Rocke, which is commonly called.<note n="*" place="margin">Nigra Rupes.</note> 
                  <hi>Nigra Rupes,</hi>
                  <pb n="348" facs="tcp:16256:178"/>and that the ſaid Rock being divers miles in circuit, is compaſſed round about with the Sea, which Sea be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the bredth of ſome miles over, doth runne out into the more large Ocean by foure ſeverall currents, which is as much to ſay, as that a good pretty way diſtant from the <hi>Nigra Rupes,</hi> there are foure ſeverall Lands of reaſonable quanti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie: and being ſituated round about the Rocke, although with ſome good diſtance, are ſevered each from other by the Sea-running be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tweene them, and making them all foure to be Ilands almoſt of equall bigneſſe. But there is no certaintie of this report, and therefore our beſt Mathematicians in this latter age have omitted it.</p>
               <p>Our travellers of later years have adventured ſo farre, to their great danger, in thoſe cold and frozen Countries, that they have deſcryed<note n="*" place="margin">Groin-Land.</note>

<pb n="349" facs="tcp:16256:178"/>to bee affirmed of the Northerne parts of <hi>America,</hi> called by ſome <hi>Eſtote</hi>-land; for the opening wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of our <hi>Engliſh-men</hi> have taken great paines, as may eaſily appeare by the new Globes and Maps, in which all the Capes, Sounds and Furlongs, are called by <hi>Engliſh</hi> names.

               <p>In like ſort, ſome of our Engliſh Merchants to their great charges, ſet forth Fleets to deſcry the Seas towards the Eaſt, yet going by the North, and there have found many unknowne Countries, as<note n="*" place="margin">Nova Zembla.</note>
